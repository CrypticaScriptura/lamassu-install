- test install-new
- don't actually start l-s at first, allow user to do it manually after set up
- fix lamassu-admin setup
- backup using masterSeed and google drive/dropbox/aws
  - for now, maybe just recommend using DO backup + backup db to encrypted file
- backup bitcoin wallet, use huge keypool to last a week


- allow user to select whether to enable bitcoin and ethereum (separate scripts)
